# Live-Script-Portfolio
A collection of Live Script MATLAB projects

This repository contains Live Script MATLAB files (.mlx) for various projects that I've completed.

If you've never used Live Scripts before, they are formatted MATLAB scripts that can contain interactive elements (e.g. sliders, dropdowns) and include output (e.g. plots) in the document.

* Some of these projects originated from the graduate class on Machine Learning in Chemistry that I teach.

* Others arose from my research lab in which we study atmospheric aerosol particles.

* Still others are just projects that I did for fun on the side!
